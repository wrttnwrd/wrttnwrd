<p>Really, does this look that exciting? If it does, there are two possibilities:

  <ol>
	<li>You are a sad, sad person with no life</li>

</ol>

If the latter, welcome!!!!

  <ul>
	<li><a href="test-3-gradient-animation.html" target="_blank">Animated background with CSS</a>. I have no idea how this works, but I layered an animated fill background over an image background, and voila.</li>
</ul>
